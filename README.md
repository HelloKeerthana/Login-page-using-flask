# Flask App Project


This is a simple Flask web application that demonstrates how to structure a project with templates and static files.

## Project Structure

The project follows the typical Flask application layout with `app.py` (or `app2.py` in this case), `templates/` for HTML files, and `static/` for CSS/JS files.

Here is the directory structure:
